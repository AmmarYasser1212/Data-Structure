# Problems
### 1. Student Struct
- Create a struct to store information about a student, such as `name`, `age`, and `GPA`. 
- Write a function that accepts an array of students and prints the student with the highest GPA.
- [The Solution]()

### 2. Point Struct and Distance Calculation
- Define a `Point` struct with `x` and `y` coordinates. 
- Write a function to calculate the distance between two points using the distance formula:
  - **Distance Formula:**  
    `distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)`
- [The Solution]()

### 3. Rectangle Area Calculation
- Define a `Rectangle` struct that holds the coordinates of two opposite corners of a rectangle. 
- Write a function to calculate the area of the rectangle based on the corner points.
   - `Area = |(x2 - x1) * (y2 - y1)|`
- [The Solution]()

### 4. Complex Number Operations
- Define a `Complex` struct to represent complex numbers (with `real` and `imaginary` parts). 
- Implement functions to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) on two complex numbers.
- [The Solution]()

### 5. Employee Struct and Salary Sorting
- Define an `Employee` struct with `name`, `ID`, and `salary`. 
- Write a program that sorts an array of employees by their salary in ascending order.
